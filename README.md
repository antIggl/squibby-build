Squibby Linux Live Build
========================

This project contains the neccessary code to build a Squibby Linux LiveCD.
For now it consists of a debian package to fetch/install neccessary deps
and a package containing the live-build configuration and build script.

Putting everything inside a single project is convenient for many reasons
(e.g., debian packaging).
